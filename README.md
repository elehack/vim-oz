This repository contains a syntax file, filetype plugin, and
ftdetect rule for using Vim to write code in the
[Oz](http://www.mozart-oz.org) programming language.

I wrote these files several years ago when using Oz for a programming
languages course. I no longer active use or maintain them; they're here
in case someone finds them useful. If you use them and wish to take
over their maintenance, drop me a line and I'll be happy to point
people your direction.

These scripts are in the public domain.
